Following the advert on Auto trader, and a subsequent chat with the dealer, I headed up to Wakefield in West Yorkshire from Kent to view a late 2003 (registered 2004) Suzuki Jimny, 63,125 miles on the clock and a single women owner.
A nurse who used the car to commute from home to the hospital, with the occasional detour to the shops. She traded the 2003 model in to upgrade to the SZ4.
Up until this point, the longest drive the car had done was 30 miles, from her home to the dealers house (or so I am told).

After 3 hours on the road after work, and a late evening test drive. I purchased this little beauty for the princely sum of Â£1,700. While trading in my old van to bring down the cash price even lower.

A quick 7 mile drive to the services, where he was topped up with fuel ready to begin the 220 mile journey home. A baptism of fire.

Neadless to say, we made it home. Arriving just after 3am with not a single issue... lets hope it continues
