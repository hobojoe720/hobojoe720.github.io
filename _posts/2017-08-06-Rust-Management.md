![Hammerite Kurust]({{ site.url }}/img/2017-08-06-Kurust.jpg)
This weekends challenge was to head off the main issue facing the Suzuki Jimny... rust. With an all metal body, and a boot pan that traps moisture it is common for rust to form here.
There are replacement boot pans available, where you can cut out the old one and weld in the new. I dont have a welder and the rust isnt bad enough to warrant it.

Annoyingly I forgot to get a pre-work photo. However, the rust wasnt overly bad and with a bit of sanding we got near enough back to bare metal where possible.
Following the elbow grease, [Hammerite Kurust](http://amzn.to/2vPcIsS) was painted over all the affected areas.

Kurust is a rust "converter", it supposidly changes the chemical composition of the rust so that it goes from a flakey oxidised metal into something solid and stops it spreading. 
To do this effectivly, the Kurust needs to come into contact with all the rust (so soak in). I went for a couple coats in the hope that it got in propperly.

After that, the Kurust needs to be painted over. For now, I have gone with a clear laqure but I will replace this down the line with a nice coat of black paint.
